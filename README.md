## Configuration

You can configure this extension using dconf. Preferences page is also available, but it's self explanatory (duh, no it's not).

All settings live under `/org/gnome/shell/extensions/hackastats` path. Here are the keys:

- `/org/gnome/shell/extensions/hackastats/api-key` - an API key for your hackatime server. Overwritten by `~/.wakatime.cfg`.
- `/org/gnome/shell/extensions/hackastats/base-url` - the base API URL for your hackatime server. Overwritten by `~/.wakatime.cfg`.
- `/org/gnome/shell/extensions/hackastats/position` - position on the GNOME panel, 0 is left, 1 is center and 2 is right. Defaults to 2 (on the right).
- `/org/gnome/shell/extensions/hackastats/refresh-interval` - how often should the data refresh, in seconds. Defaults to 30.

## Usage

Configure base url and api key (in dconf or by setting them in `~/.wakatime.cfg`).
If the displayed text says `Server unavailable`, the extension cannot access the server.
This usually means that you don't have network access or your base url is wrong.
